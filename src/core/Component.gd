extends Resource
class_name Component

## Base resource for game components in the entity-component system.
## Components hold data and helper logic but no scene tree behaviour.
## Designed for Godot 4.4.1.

# This class intentionally contains no functionality; it exists to provide
# a common ancestor for all component resources.
