BASE CHARACTER STAT SHEET 
With full concept descriptions


Base Stats– 

Job  – profession or training or role, the number of them available is going to be moderate at start, and just keep increasing as the game progresses, typical to a “card collection” style. The Player generated Characters start with the ability to choose from a pool of 5 or so, and availability expands through Player meta-progress.  Randomly generated characters that join the Player are generated from whatever pool is required (up to max available).

Health – health points, typically by job formula (for example STR+AGL for a fighter, Body pool + INT for a scientist, etc) when at 0, dead

Energy – energy points, generated also by job formula,  used primarily for skills

Armor – amount of protection from damage, by job formula and modified by anything (as well as a value which may change depending on opposing weapon or skill)

AP – action points are the budget of points available for movement and skills and other actions in a combat round, and are derived in different ways for different classes, by relating directly to Attributes and/or other stats.  The formulas are quite diverse, and directly reflective of the class in question (for example, AGL+WIS for a brawler, SPD+AGL for a ninja, and INT+AGL for a sorcerer, Mind pool+WIS for a monk, etc. and so on)
Status – status effects of all kinds, both short term and long term, such as ‘Morale’ (short and long) and ‘Poisoned’ (only short) and ‘Diseased’ (short and long) and ‘Aged’ (only long) etc, which cause modifiers of all kinds

Resistances and Vulnerabilities – resist or vulnerable to various status effects and traits and skills and so on, typically rare

XP – experience points, or amount of progression towards the next Level

LVL – character level, their overall amount of expertise or mastery in their given job or profession or training (numerically derived but translated as a Title)

Traits - A few are chosen by the character, at character creation and at some LVL progressions - but most are derived from stat values, player actions, and so on - for example STR:4 = "strong", and Thievery: 10 "master criminal" and after killing 100 goblins "goblin slayer".  These traits are used to give modifiers and drive the procedural systems.


Attributes- 

derived from 2 pools, Body and Mind.  Fixed points can never be reallocated.  Relative points can be moved to and from any related Attribute to and from the related pool during a “Camp Rest” period on the World Map.  Most characters at the highest level will never have more than 2 or 3 points available in a pool at any given time.  Almost all beginning characters only have 1 in any pool at any given time, for quite a while – (unless they find secrets or treasures or otherwise, etc).The amount of fixed or relative points available AFTER Level 1 depends on character job and other variables.  

Body pool – controls health points generation 
(Base LVL points: 5 fixed, 1 relative)

STR, – strength, controls ‘% to hit’ chance melee and damage, weight limit
AGL, – agility, controls ‘% to hit’ chance ranged, stealth movement/abilities
SPD – speed, initiative bonus, AP bonus, and movement distance per AP

Mind pool – controls energy points generation 
(Base LVL points: 5 fixed, 1 relative)

INT, – intelligence, controls skill slot amount, skill option amount
WIS, – wisdom, controls XP modifiers, skill option upgrade path
CHR – charisma, controls speech interactions, other social modifiers



Training-  

Can be used for various “Checks” in the game that will occur in every layer of the game – World Map (such as Lore for knowing routes, Diplomacy for entering a location, Technical for item creation/maintenance), Combat Map (Combat for raw ability, Athletics to climb, Thievery for stealth movement) and Text Adventure Mode, (such as “pick pocket” or “lie to King” or “sneak by guard” etc). They can also give various modifiers to specific Skills that allow it

Athletics – from STR, SPD and Job
Combat – from STR, AGL and Job
Thievery – from AGL, SPD and Job
Diplomacy – from WIS, CHR and Job
Lore – from INT, CHR and Job
Technical – from INT, WIS and Job


[Advanced Training – 

Other unique Training become available as LVL progression and from other specific situations]



Skills–  

These skills are handled primarily by a separate SkillComponent system, but are also listed here by name (along with its Level, and options unlocked), as another base Stat for whichever character they belong to.  They are gained by the player in a way that is almost identical to card-collection – and they are randomly selected by procedural formula in generated characters.
The type ranges from ‘basic’ and universal, to ‘common’, ‘rare’, ‘unique’ and ‘legendary’ — in 4 possible categories:

 — Melee — Ranged —Defense — Utility —-

For example “Single Shot” (basic) allows any ranged weapon to shoot once.  “Automatic Fire” (common) allows supported ranged weapons to shoot in a full auto mode.  “Ricochet” (rare) allows supported ranged weapons to bounce a shot  — and so on..  The same occurs for every available category.  Skill options are levels of different “abililties” within each Skill itself.  Every skill has unlockable options of some sort, typically 3 different levels.  Some have more options than others, and these skills may have unique skill trees all their own.  INT controls how many you can Skill options you can pick from, in your “selected Skill options” — and WIS controls how many Skill options you can learn total.

Items-

Character gear and equipment.  These are their own unique entities starting as a default “Item” outlined fully in the “Base Item Document” – and then outlined more fully in whatever “Item archetype” it is.  Any rareness above that has its own specific stats which modify this even further.
